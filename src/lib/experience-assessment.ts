ðŸŽ¯ **Why this level?**
- You'll start with basic movements and progress gradually
- Emphasis on form and tendon adaptation (Daniel Vadel method)
- Perfect for building a strong foundation without injury risk

ðŸš€ **What to expect:**
- Push-up and pull-up progressions
- Core strengthening exercises  
- 2-3 sessions per week to start
- Clear progression markers`,

    intermediate: `You've been classified as **intermediate** - you have good baseline strength and some training experience!

ðŸŽ¯ **Why this level?**
- You can handle more challenging variations
- Ready for structured progression systems
- Can train with moderate intensity safely

ðŸš€ **What to expect:**
- Advanced push-up and pull-up variations
- Introduction to ring training
- 3-4 sessions per week
- Skills development alongside strength`,

    advanced: `Welcome to the **advanced program**! Your strength levels and experience qualify you for challenging progressions.

ðŸŽ¯ **Why this level?**
- You have excellent baseline strength
- Experience with training principles
- Ready for advanced skills and high intensity

ðŸš€ **What to expect:**
- Advanced ring movements and skills
- Complex progression schemes
- 4-5 sessions per week
- Focus on mastery and refinement`,
